 abstract = {Here we developed a spatio-temporal bone remodeling model to simulate the action of Basic Multicelluar Units (BMUs). This model is based on two major extensions of a temporal-only bone cell population model (BCPM). First, the differentiation into mature resorbing osteoclasts and mature forming osteoblasts from their respective precursor cells was modelled as an intermittent process based on precursor cells availability. Second, the interaction between neighbouring BMUs was considered based on a {\textquotedbl}metabolic cost{\textquotedbl} argument which warrants that no new BMU will be activated in the neighbourhood of an existing BMU. With the proposed model we have simulated the phases of the remodelling process obtaining average periods similar to those found in the literature: resorption ( $\sim$22 days)-reversal ($\sim$8~days)-formation ($\sim$65~days)-quiescence (560-600~days) and an average BMU activation frequency of $\sim$1.6~BMUs/year/mm3. We further show here that the resorption and formation phases of the BMU become coordinated only by the presence of TGF-\textgreek{b} (transforming growth factor \textgreek{b}), i.e., a major coupling factor stored in the bone matrix. TGF-\textgreek{b} is released through resorption so upregulating osteoclast apoptosis and accumulation of osteoblast precursors, i.e., facilitating the transition from the resorption to the formation phase at a given remodelling site. Finally, we demonstrate that this model can explain targeted bone remodelling as the BMUs are steered towards damaged bone areas in order to commence bone matrix repair.},

@article{Hambli.2014,
 abstract = {Bone adaptation occurs as a response to external loadings and involves bone resorption by osteoclasts followed by the formation of new bone by osteoblasts. It is directly triggered by the transduction phase by osteocytes embedded within the bone matrix. The bone remodeling process is governed by the interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts through the expression of several autocrine and paracrine factors that control bone cell populations and their relative rate of differentiation and proliferation. A review of the literature shows that despite the progress in bone remodeling simulation using the finite element (FE) method, there is still a lack of predictive models that explicitly consider the interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts combined with the mechanical response of bone. The current study attempts to develop an FE model to describe the bone remodeling process, taking into consideration the activities of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The mechanical behavior of bone is described by taking into account the bone material fatigue damage accumulation and mineralization. A coupled strain-damage stimulus function is proposed, which controls the level of autocrine and paracrine factors. The cellular behavior is based on Komarova et al.'s (2003) dynamic law, which describes the autocrine and paracrine interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts and computes cell population dynamics and changes in bone mass at a discrete site of bone remodeling. Therefore, when an external mechanical stress is applied, bone formation and resorption is governed by cells dynamic rather than adaptive elasticity approaches. The proposed FE model has been implemented in the FE code Abaqus (UMAT routine). An example of human proximal femur is investigated using the model developed. The model was able to predict final human proximal femur adaptation similar to the patterns observed in a human proximal femur. The results obtained reveal complex spatio-temporal bone adaptation. The proposed FEM model gives insight into how bone cells adapt their architecture to the mechanical and biological environment.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The resistance of the bone against damage by repairing itself and adapting to environmental conditions is its most important property. These adaptive changes are regulated by physiological process commonly called the bone remodeling. Better understanding this process requires that we apply the theory of elastic-damage under the hypothesis of small displacements to a bone structure and see its mechanical behavior.

RESULTS

The purpose of the present study is to simulate a two dimensional model of a proximal femur by taking into consideration elastic-damage and mechanical stimulus. Here, we present a mathematical model based on a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and we develop the variational formulation for the mechanical problem. Then, we implement our mathematical model into the finite element method algorithm to investigate the effect of the damage.

CONCLUSION

The results are consistent with the existing literature which shows that the bone stiffness drops in damaged bone structure under mechanical loading.},

 abstract = {One of only a few approved and available anabolic treatments for severe osteoporosis is daily injections of PTH (1-34). This drug has a specific dual action which can act either anabolically or catabolically depending on the type of administration, i.e. intermittent or continuous, respectively. In this paper, we present a mechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of the action of PTH in postmenopausal osteoporosis. This model accounts for anabolic and catabolic activities in bone remodelling under intermittent and continuous administration of PTH. The model predicts evolution of common bone biomarkers and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) over time. We compared the relative changes in BV/TV resulting from a daily injection of 20 [Formula: see text]g of PTH with experimental data from the literature. Simulation results indicate a site-specific bone gain of 8.66[Formula: see text] (9.4 $\pm$ 1.13[Formula: see text]) at the lumbar spine and 3.14[Formula: see text] (2.82 $\pm$ 0.72[Formula: see text]) at the femoral neck. Bone gain depends nonlinearly on the administered dose, being, respectively, 0.68[Formula: see text], 3.4[Formula: see text] and 6.16[Formula: see text] for a 10, 20 and 40 [Formula: see text]g PTH dose at the FN over 2 years. Simulations were performed also taking into account a bone mechanical disuse to reproduce elderly frail subjects. The results show that mechanical disuse ablates the effects of PTH and leads to a 1.08{\%} reduction of bone gain at the FN over a 2-year treatment period for the 20 [Formula: see text]g of PTH. The developed model can simulate a range of pathological conditions and treatments in bones including different PTH doses, different mechanical loading environments and combinations. Consequently, the model can be used for testing and generating hypotheses related to synergistic action between PTH treatment and physical activity.},

@article{Lemaire.2004,
 abstract = {We propose a mathematical model explaining the interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, two cell types specialized in the maintenance of the bone integrity. Bone is a dynamic, living tissue whose structure and shape continuously evolves during life. It has the ability to change architecture by removal of old bone and replacement with newly formed bone in a localized process called remodeling. The model described here is based on the idea that the relative proportions of immature and mature osteoblasts control the degree of osteoclastic activity. In addition, osteoclasts control osteoblasts differentially depending on their stage of differentiation. Despite the tremendous complexity of the bone regulatory system and its fragmentary understanding, we obtain surprisingly good correlations between the model simulations and the experimental observations extracted from the literature. The model results corroborate all behaviors of the bone remodeling system that we have simulated, including the tight coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the catabolic effect induced by continuous administration of PTH, the catabolic action of RANKL, as well as its reversal by soluble antagonist OPG. The model is also able to simulate metabolic bone diseases such as estrogen deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, senescence and glucocorticoid excess. Conversely, possible routes for therapeutic interventions are tested and evaluated. Our model confirms that anti-resorptive therapies are unable to partially restore bone loss, whereas bone formation therapies yield better results. The model enables us to determine and evaluate potential therapies based on their efficacy. In particular, the model predicts that combinations of anti-resorptive and anabolic therapies provide significant benefits compared with monotherapy, especially for certain type of skeletal disease. Finally, the model clearly indicates that increasing the size of the pool of preosteoblasts is an essential ingredient for the therapeutic manipulation of bone formation. This model was conceived as the first step in a bone turnover modeling platform. These initial modeling results are extremely encouraging and lead us to proceed with additional explorations into bone turnover and skeletal remodeling.},

 abstract = {We propose a multiscale mechanobiological model of bone remodelling to investigate the site-specific evolution of bone volume fraction across the midshaft of a femur. The model includes hormonal regulation and biochemical coupling of bone cell populations, the influence of the microstructure on bone turnover rate, and mechanical adaptation of the tissue. Both microscopic and tissue-scale stress/strain states of the tissue are calculated from macroscopic loads by a combination of beam theory and micromechanical homogenisation. This model is applied to simulate the spatio-temporal evolution of a human midshaft femur scan subjected to two deregulating circumstances: (i) osteoporosis and (ii) mechanical disuse. Both simulated deregulations led to endocortical bone loss, cortical wall thinning and expansion of the medullary cavity, in accordance with experimental findings. Our model suggests that these observations are attributable to a large extent to the influence of the microstructure on bone turnover rate. Mechanical adaptation is found to help preserve intracortical bone matrix near the periosteum. Moreover, it leads to non-uniform cortical wall thickness due to the asymmetry of macroscopic loads introduced by the bending moment. The effect of mechanical adaptation near the endosteum can be greatly affected by whether the mechanical stimulus includes stress concentration effects or not.},

@article{Martin.2019,
 abstract = {Significant progress has been made to identify the cells and signaling molecules involved in the mechanobiological regulation of bone remodeling. It is now well accepted that osteocytes act as mechanosensory cells in bone expressing several signaling molecules such as nitric oxide (NO) and sclerostin (Scl) which are able to control bone remodeling responses. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multiscale computational model of bone remodeling which incorporates biochemical osteocyte feedback. The mechanostat theory is quantitatively incorporated into the model using mechanical feedback to control expression levels of NO and Scl. The catabolic signaling pathway RANK-RANKL-OPG is co-regulated via (continuous) PTH and NO, while the anabolic Wnt signaling pathway is described via competitive binding reactions between Wnt, Scl and the Wnt receptors LRP5/6. Using this novel model of bone remodeling, we investigate the effects of changes in the mechanical loading and hormonal environment on bone balance. Our numerical simulations show that we can calibrate the mechanostat anabolic and catabolic regulatory mechanisms so that they are mutually exclusive. This is consistent with previous models that use a Wolff-type law to regulate bone resorption and formation separately. Furthermore, mechanical feedback provides an effective mechanism to obtain physiological bone loss responses due to mechanical disuse and/or osteoporosis.},

 abstract = {Denosumab is one of the most commonly prescribed anti-resorptive drugs for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The therapeutic effect of denosumab is to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and consequently bone resorption. Gains in bone mineral density (BMD) are achieved based on the ability of the bone matrix to undergo secondary mineralization. Experimental data show that the increase of BMD after commencing denosumab treatment are bone site specific. In this paper, we developed a comprehensive mechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodymamic (PK-PD) model of the effect of denosumab on bone remodeling in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). The PD model is based on a bone cell population model describing the bone remodeling process at the tissue scale. The conceptual model of the bone mineralization process, originally proposed by Boivin and Meunier, is quantitatively incorporated using a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue algorithm. The latter takes into account the balance of mineral within bone tissue due to the mineralization process, distinguishing the primary and secondary phases and removal of bone matrix due to bone resorption. The numerical simulations show that the model is able to predict the bone-site specific increase in BMD as was observed in the experimental data of Bone et al. 2008 for a typical denosumab administration pattern of 60 mg every 6 months. At the hip a 5 {\%} increase in BMD was observed, while at the lumbar spine a 7.5 {\%} increase of BMD was achieved after a 2 year treatment period. The difference in BMD is due to the fact that bone turnover at the hip is lower compared to lumbar spine and consequently has less potential for secondary mineralization. Parametric studies revealed that the rate of bone mineralization is an essential parameter regulating BMD gains. If mineralization is neglected only minimal increases in BMD are observed.},

 abstract = {Temporal aspects of ligand specificity have been shown to play a significant role in the case of pulsatile hormone secretion, as exemplified by parathyroid hormone (PTH) binding to its receptor (PTH1R), a G-protein-coupled receptor expressed on surfaces of osteoblasts and osteocytes. The latter binding reaction regulates intracellular signalling and subsequently modulates skeletal homeostasis via bone remodelling. PTH glandular secretion patterns dictate bone cellular activity. In healthy humans, 70{\%} of PTH is secreted in a tonic fashion, whereas 30{\%} is secreted in low-amplitude and high-frequency bursts occurring every 10-20 min, superimposed on the tonic secretion. Changes in the PTH secretion patterns have been associated with various bone diseases. In this paper, we analyse PTH glandular secretion patterns for healthy and pathological states and their link to bone cellular responsiveness (\textgreek{a}R). We utilise a two-state receptor ligand binding model of PTH to PTH1R together with a cellular activity function which is able to distinguish various aspects of the stimulation signal including peak dose, time of ligand exposure, and exposure period. Formulating and solving several constrained optimisation problems, we investigate the potential of pharmacological manipulation of the diseased glandular secretion and via clinical approved external PTH injections to restore healthy bone cellular responsiveness. Based on the mean experimentally reported data, our simulation results indicate cellular responsiveness in healthy subjects is sensitive to the tonic baseline stimulus and it is 28{\%} of the computed maximum responsiveness. Simulation results for pathological cases of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism, initial and steady state hypocalcemia clamp tests indicate \textgreek{a}R values significantly larger than the healthy baseline (1.7, 2.2, 4.9 and 1.9-times, respectively). Manipulation of the pulsatile glandular secretion pattern, while keeping the mean PTH concentration constant, allowed restoration of healthy baseline values from these catabolic bone diseases. Conversely, PTH glandular diseases that led to maximum bone cellular responsiveness below the healthy baseline value can't be restored to baseline via glandular manipulation. However, external PTH injections allowed restoration of these latter cases.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW

Bone adapts structure and material properties in response to its mechanical environment, a process called mechanoadpatation. For the past 50~years, finite element modeling has been used to investigate the relationships between bone geometry, material properties, and mechanical loading conditions. This review examines how we use finite element modeling in the context of bone mechanoadpatation.

RECENT FINDINGS

Finite element models estimate complex mechanical stimuli at the tissue and cellular levels, help explain experimental results, and inform the design of loading protocols and prosthetics. FE modeling is a powerful tool to study bone adaptation as it complements experimental approaches. Before using FE models, researchers should determine whether simulation results will provide complementary information to experimental or clinical observations and should establish the level of complexity required. As imaging technics and computational capacity continue increasing, we expect FE models to help in designing treatments of bone pathologies that take advantage of mechanoadaptation of bone.},

@article{Pivonka.2008,
 abstract = {It is generally accepted that RANKL is highly expressed in osteoblast precursor cells while OPG is highly expressed in mature osteoblasts, but to date no functional utility to the BMU has been proposed for this particular ligand-decoy-receptor expression profile. As discovered in the mid 90s, the RANK-RANKL-OPG signaling cascade is a major signaling pathway regulating bone remodeling. In this paper we study theoretically the functional implications of particular RANKL/OPG expression profiles on bone volume. For this purpose we formulate an extended bone-cell dynamics model describing functional behaviour of basic multicellular units (BMUs) responsible for bone resorption and formation. This model incorporates the RANK-RANKL-OPG signaling together with the regulating action of TGF-beta on bone cells. The bone-cell population model employed here builds on the work of Lemaire et al. (2004) [1], but incorporates the following significant modifications: (i) addition of a rate equation describing changes in bone volume with time as the key 'output function' tracking functional behaviour of BMUs, (ii) a rate equation describing release of TGF-beta from the bone matrix, (iii) expression of OPG and RANKL on both osteoblastic cell lines, and (iv) modified activator/repressor functions. Using bone volume as a functional selection criterion, we find that there is a preferred arrangement for ligand expression on particular cell types, and further, that this arrangement coincides with biological observations. We then investigate the model parameter space combinatorially, searching for preferred 'groupings' of changes in differentiation rates of various cell types. Again, a criterion of bone volume change is employed to identify possible ways of optimally controlling BMU responses. While some combinations of changes in differentiation rates are clearly unrealistic, other combinations of changes in differentiation rates are potentially functionally significant. Most importantly, the combination of parameter changes representing the signaling pathway for TGF-beta gives a unique result that appears to have a clear biological rationale. The methodological approach for the investigation of model structure described here offers a theoretical explanation as to why TGF-beta has its particular suite of biological effects on bone-cell differentiation rates.},

@article{Potter.2005,
 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) kinetics, focusing on the receptor's response to PTH dosing to discern bone formation responses from bone resorption. The PTH1R is a major target for new osteoporosis treatments, as pulsatile PTH dosing has been shown to induce net bone formation in both animals and humans, and PTH(1-34) was recently FDA approved for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. PTH has also been shown to cause net bone loss when given continuously, so that the net action of PTH on bone is dependent on the dosing pattern. We have developed a simplified two-state receptor kinetics model for the PTH1R, based on the concepts of Segel et al., to distinguish the activity of active and inactive receptor and receptor-ligand complexes. The goal is to develop a plausible model of the minimal essential biological relationships necessary for understanding the responses to PTH dosing. A two-state model is able to effectively discriminate between continuous and pulsatile PTH dosing using the active species as surrogates for the downstream anabolic response. For continuous PTH dosing, the model predicts a desensitized system dominated by the inactive receptor and complex, consistent with downstream net bone loss that has been demonstrated experimentally. Using pulsatile PTH dosing, the model system predicts a highly sensitized state dominated by the active receptor and complex, corresponding to net bone formation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the kinetics of the receptor plays a critical role in the downstream effects of PTH dosing. Moreover, these results indicate that within a range of biologically relevant PTH doses, the two-state model is able to capture the differential behavior of the system for both continuous and pulsatile PTH dosing. The development of such a model provides a rational basis for developing more biologically extensive models that may support the design of optimal dosing strategies for PTH-based anti-osteoporosis treatments. Moreover, this model provides a unique starting point from which to design experiments investigating PTH receptor biology.},

 abstract = {Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, has been approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The therapeutic effect of denosumab rests on its ability to inhibit osteoclast differentiation. Here, we present a computational approach on the basis of coupling a pharmacokinetics model of denosumab with a pharmacodynamics model for quantifying the effect of denosumab on bone remodeling. The pharmacodynamics model comprises an integrated systems biology-continuum micromechanics approach, including a bone cell population model, considering the governing biochemical factors of bone remodeling (including the action of denosumab), and a multiscale micromechanics-based bone mechanics model, for implementing the mechanobiology of bone remodeling in our model. Numerical studies of postmenopausal osteoporosis show that denosumab suppresses osteoclast differentiation, thus strongly curtailing bone resorption. Simulation results also suggest that denosumab may trigger a short-term bone volume gain, which is, however, followed by constant or decreasing bone volume. This evolution is accompanied by a dramatic decrease of the bone turnover rate by more than one order of magnitude. The latter proposes dominant occurrence of secondary mineralization (which is not anymore impeded through cellular activity), leading to higher mineral concentration per bone volume. This explains the overall higher bone mineral density observed in denosumab-related clinical studies.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of the action of PTH(1-34) on bone modelling and remodelling, developed for quantitatively investigating the dose- and administration pattern-dependency of the bone tissue response to this drug. Firstly, a PK model of PTH(1-34) was developed, accounting for administration via subcutaneous injections. Subsequently, the PK model was coupled to a (mechanistic) bone cell population model of bone modelling and remodelling, taking into account the effects of PTH(1-34) on the differentiation of lining cells into active osteoblasts, on the apoptosis of active osteoblasts, and on proliferation of osteoblast precursors, as well as on the key regulatory pathways of bone cell activities. Numerical simulations show that the coupled PK/PD model is able to distinguish between continuous and intermittent administration patterns of PTH(1-34), in terms of yielding both catabolic bone responses (if drug administration is carried out continuously) and anabolic bone responses (if drug administration is carried out intermittently). The model also features a non-linear relation between bone gain and drug dose (as known from experiments); doubling the dose from 80 \textgreek{m}g/kg/day to 160 \textgreek{m}g/kg/day induced a 1.3-fold increase of the bone volume-to-total volume ratio. Furthermore, the model presented in this paper confirmed that bone modelling represents an essential mechanism of the anabolic response of bone to PTH(1-34) administration in rat models, and that the large amount of bone formation observed in such models cannot be explained via remodelling alone.},

abstract = {Bone remodeling is a process involving removal of mature bone tissue and subsequent formation of new bone tissue. This process is driven by complex actions of biological cells and biochemical factors, and it is sensitive to the loads applied onto the skeleton. Herein, we develop a mathematical framework describing this process at the (macroscopic) level of cortical bone, by combining, for the first time, bone cell population kinetics with multiscale bone mechanics. Key variables are concentrations of biological cells (osteoclasts, osteoblasts and their progenitors) and biochemical factors (RANK, RANKL, OPG, PTH, and TGF-β), as well as mechanical strains, both at the (“macroscopic”) level of cortical bone and at the (“microscopic”) level of the extravascular bone matrix. Multiscale bone mechanics delivers, as a function of the vascular porosity, the relation between the macroscopic strains resulting from the loads, and the microscopic strains, which are known to modulate, either directly, or via poromechanical couplings such as hydrostatic pressure or fluid flow, the expression or proliferation behavior of the biological cells residing in, or attached to the extravascular bone matrix. Hence, these microscopic strains enter the biochemical kinetics laws governing cell expression, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Without any additional phenomenologically motivated paradigm, this novel approach is able to explain the experimentally observed evolutions of bone mass in postmenopausal osteoporosis and under microgravity conditions: namely, a decrease of bone loss over time.}
